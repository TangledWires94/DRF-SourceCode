This was the first project I worked on when I was first put onto furlough in March 2020. Portal is one of my big game design inspirations so i wanted to make soemthing with the same feeling.
I really liked the idea and started putting ideas into a design doc but my PC increasingly had issues rendering the environment and baking the lighting so I had to drop it in favour of 2D projects.
When I one day upgrade my PC I'd like to continue it and add some more puzzles and mechanics.
